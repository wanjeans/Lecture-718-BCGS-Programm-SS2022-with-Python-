    "## About the Projects\n",
    "- You will get one project approximately every other week.\n",
    "- Besides the homework-assignmentts, you need to solve the projects in order to pass the course. Your final course mark consists of the mean of your project marks. We aim to hand-out six projects during the term and we do not consider the worst project mark for your final course mark. Projects that you do not hand in are counted with a mark of 4.\n",
    "- The projects needs to be submitted by uploading a modified version of this notebook to [Projects/Project 1](https://ecampus.uni-bonn.de/goto_ecampus_exc_2645968.html) on eCampus. Please only upload this notebook and no other files. You also do not need to change its filename before your upload. Your project must be on eCampus by Wednesday, 11.05.2022, 23:59. **No late uploads can be accepted!**\n",
    "- **In contrast to the homework exercises, each student must hand in an own solution for the projects! Of course you can and should discuss problems with each other! However, you need to be able to explain your solution in detail to your tutor and/or the lecturers! We might ask you for an interview about your project if the solution is (close to) identical to another students submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The tutors, Thomas and I are very happy to help you out with difficulties you might have with the project tasks! You can ask questions any time but please do so well in advance of the deadlines!"

    "# Floating wind turbines\n",
    "Currently, the demand for renewable energy is very high. Wind turbines are very successful sources of renewable energy, and many states are planning new wind farms to increase the fraction of green energy in the overall consumption. Despite the high demand, it is difficult to establish large new onshore (land-based) wind farms due to space limitations: Attention has to be paid to landscape and neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same constraints do not limit offshore wind farms. However, the conventional offshore wind turbine has a foundation which stands on the seafloor. The foundations are limited to a certain height, as the price and complexity of the foundation scales with the water depth. According to Wikipedia, fixed foundations can be installed at sea depth up to around 50 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "This limits the possible wind farm locations to very few areas in the world where the ocean floor falls off relatively flatly away from the shore. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, floating foundations are now being developed by many companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "While floating wind turbine foundations may solve many problems related to installation of offshore wind, the technologies are still being tested. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will work with simulated data measured for a floating foundation with a with a 15 MW wind turbine. For comparison, the standard offshore wind turbine is certified for on the order of 8 MW. Wind turbines in producing in the range of 15-20 MW are being pursued by many of the manufacturing companies. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### This project\n",
    "In this project, we will consider data from simulations of a floating 15 MW offshore turbine in operation. The data contains the values shown in this figure as a function of time. \n",
