    "## About the Projects\n",
    "- You will get one project approximately every other week.\n",
    "- Besides the homework-assignmentts, you need to solve the projects in order to pass the course. Your final course mark consists of the mean of your project marks. We aim to hand-out six projects during the term and we do not consider the worst project mark for your final course mark. Projects that you do not hand in are counted with a mark of 4.\n",
    "- The projecs needs to be submitted by uploading a Unix-`tar` archive containing the modified files `word_game.py` and `word_module.py` to [Projects/Project 2](https://ecampus.uni-bonn.de/goto_ecampus_exc_2645968.html) on eCampus. The name of your `tar`-archive should be `YOUR_NAME.tgz`. Please only include the two files mentioned above and *no* other files. Your project must be on eCampus by Wednesday, 25.05.2022, 23:59. **No late uploads can be accepted!**\n",
    "- **In contrast to the homework exercises, each student must hand in an own solution for the projects! Of course you can and should discuss problems with each other! However, you need to be able to explain your solution in detail to your tutor and/or the lecturers! We might ask you for an interview about your project if the solution is (close to) identical to another students submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:** (1) This project asks you to write a `Python`-script which needs to be deceloped and executed on a `Linux`-environment, e.g. the `Desktop` within our Jupyterlab system; (2) The tutors, Nina and I are very happy to help you out with difficulties you might have with the project tasks! You can ask questions any time but please do so well in advance of the deadlines!"

    "### Rules of the game\n",
    "\n",
    "We start describing the (basic) rules of the game. It is a Scrabble-like game for a single player. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words using their letters. Each **valid** word earns the user points, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific rules are as follows:\n",
    "1. *Dealing and Playing*\n",
    "    1. A player is dealt a hand of `HAND_SIZE` letters of the alphabet, chosen at random with rules on the distribution of consonants, vowels and jokers. This may include multiple instances of a particular letter\n",
    "    2. The player arranges the hand into as many words as they want out of the letters, but using each letter at most once.\n",
    "    3. Some letters may remain unused, though the size of the hand when a word is played\n",
    "does affect its score.\n",
    "2. *Scoring*\n",
    "    1. The score for the hand is the sum of the score for each word formed.\n",
    "    2. The score for a word is the **product** of two components:\n",
    "       1. First component: the sum of the points for letters in the word.\n",
    "       2. Second component: either $7 w_l - 3(n - w_l)$ or 1, whichever value is greater.\n",
    "          $w_l$ is the number of letters used in the word and $n$ is the number of letters available in the current hand.\n",
    "    3. Letters are scored as in Scrabble; `a` is worth 1, `b` is worth 3, `c` is worth 3, `d` is worth 2, `e` is worth 1, and so on. We already have defined the dictionary `SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES` with those values for you.\n",
    "    4. **Example:** If $n=6$ and the hand includes 1 `w`, 2 `e`s, and 1 `d` (as well as two other letters), playing the word `weed` would be worth 176 points: $(4+1+1+2) \\cdot (7\\cdot 4 - 3\\cdot(6-4)) = 176$. The first term is the sum of the values of each letter used; the second term is the special computation that rewards a player for playing a longer word, and penalizes them for any left over letters."

    "### Getting Started\n",
    "1. In contrast to the homework tasks and project 1, this project needs to be done within a `Linux`-environment. You need to develop a stand-alone script which can be run on a `Linux` command line.\n",
    "2. Store the files [word_game.py](project_code/word_game.py), [word_module.py](project_code/word_module.py), [test_word_module.py](project_code/test_word_module.py) and [words_alpha.txt](project_code/words_alpha.txt) on your disk. For this task, you will need to extend and to modify the files `word_module.py` and `word_game.py`. You *cannot* work with a notebook for this project! **Please do not change/modify any of the files until specified!**\n",
    "3. The file `word_module.py` is a module containing necessary constants and functions for the game. You will first write some new functions in this file and test them one after the other with the code in `test_word_module.py`. At the end, you will write the game execution application in `word_game.py`. This modular approach of program development, where you continuously test small parts and functions before moving on is called `unit-testing`.\n",
    "4. Run the script `test_word_module.py` within the directory where you stored all the code files. This ensures that everything is set up correctly to get you going. The script tests the modules in `word_module.py`. At this point, only the function to load a list of English words from disk is implemented. If everything is fine, you see:\n",

    "\n",
    "   If you obtain an `IOError`, then make sure that `words_alpha.txt` is in the source directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The file `word_module.py` has a number of already-implemented functions you can use while writing up your solution. You can ignore the code between the following comments, though you should read and understand everything else.\n",

    "`l`, `m`, `u`, `i`, `l`. In our program, a hand will be represented as a dictionary: the keys are\n",
    "(lowercase) letters and the values are the number of times the particular letter is repeated\n",
