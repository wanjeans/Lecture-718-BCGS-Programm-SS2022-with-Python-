    "# Floating wind turbines\n",
    "Currently, the demand for renewable energy is very high. Wind turbines are very successful sources of renewable energy, and many states are planning new wind farms to increase the fraction of green energy in the overall consumption. Despite the high demand, it is difficult to establish large new onshore (land-based) wind farms due to space limitations: Attention has to be paid to landscape and neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same constraints do not limit offshore wind farms. However, a conventional offshore wind turbine has a foundation which stands on the seafloor. The foundations are limited to a certain water depth, since the price and complexity of the foundation scales unfavorably with depth. According to Wikipedia, fixed foundations can be installed at water depth up to around 50 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "This depth constraint limits the possible wind farm locations to a moderate number of areas in the world where the ocean floor falls off relatively flatly away from the shore. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, floating foundations are now being developed by many companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "While floating wind turbine foundations may solve many problems related to installation of offshore wind, the technologies are still being tested. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will work with simulated operational data for a floating foundation fitted with a 15 MW wind turbine. At the present time the average size of offshore wind turbines is on the order of 8 MW, but wind turbines in producing in the range of 15-20 MW are being pursued by many of the manufacturing companies. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### This project\n",
    "In this project, we will again consider the dataset we used in the last project. \n",
    "The data are simulations of a floating 15 MW offshore turbine. The dataset we used in the previous project is for the 50-year event, an extreme storm which occurs very rarely, on time-scales of 50 years. Under such conditions, the rotor blades are turned such that act as aerodynamic they brakes, and the rotor is only turning at a very slow speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous project, we studied the time-domain of this dataset,  i.e. the data presented as values as a function of time. We will now study the data in the frequency domain, i.e. the frequency components of this dataset.\n",
